2. **ES6 and Modern JavaScript:**
   - Arrow functions
   - Destructuring assignment
   - Template literals
   - Let and const
   - Classes and inheritance
   - Modules (import/export) 

   ES6, short for ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, 
   which is the scripting language specification that JavaScript is based on. 
   ES6 introduced significant enhancements and new features to the JavaScript language, 
   providing developers with more tools and syntactic sugar to write clean, efficient, and expressive code.

When people refer to "modern JavaScript," they are generally talking about the practices 
and features introduced in and after ES6. Modern JavaScript encompasses the latest ECMAScript specifications, 
as well as contemporary coding patterns and best practices.

Key features introduced in ES6 and considered part of modern JavaScript include:

1. **Arrow Functions:** A concise syntax for writing functions, especially useful for 
short anonymous functions and functions with a simple body.

2. **Destructuring Assignment:** A syntax that allows unpacking values from arrays or 
properties from objects into distinct variables, making code more concise.

3. **Template Literals:** A more expressive way to concatenate strings and include expressions 
inside strings using backticks (`).

4. **let and const:** `let` and `const` introduced block-scoping, replacing the sometimes 
confusing behavior of `var`. `let` allows variable reassignment, while `const` declares constants.

5. **Classes and Inheritance:** The introduction of class syntax, making it easier to 
create and extend object-oriented code, simplifying the prototype chain.

6. **Modules (import/export):** A standardized way to organize code into reusable and 
maintainable modules, promoting a more modular approach to building applications.

7. **Promises:** A built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations, 
providing a more structured and readable way to deal with asynchronous code than callback functions.

8. **Default Parameters:** Allows function parameters to have default values, 
reducing the need for boilerplate code.

9. **Rest and Spread Operators:** The `...` syntax for both rest and spread operations, 
providing a concise way to handle variable arguments in functions or spread elements in arrays.

10. **Enhanced Object Literals:** Shorthand syntax for defining methods and properties in object literals, 
making object creation more concise.

11. **Symbol:** A new primitive data type, providing a way to create unique identifiers, 
which is useful for creating private object properties and avoiding naming collisions.

These features, along with subsequent additions in newer ECMAScript specifications 
(ES7, ES8, ES9, and so on), collectively define what is considered modern JavaScript. 
Developers often use these features to write more efficient, readable, and maintainable code. 
It's essential for JavaScript developers to stay up-to-date with modern practices to leverage 
the full capabilities of the language.

// Traditional function

   return a + b;

function Multi(a,b){return a*b;}

// Arrow function
const addArrow = (a, b) => a + b;
const MultiArrow = (a,b) => a*b;

// Case 1: Single parameter
const square = x => x * x;

// Case 2: No parameters
const greet = () => console.log('Hello!');

// Case 3: Returning an object (maybe more than one)
const createPerson = (name, age) => ({ name, age });

// Case 4: Using with array functions
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(x => x * x); 
/*
 The map function is used to iterate over each element 
 of the numbers array and apply a function to each element, 
 creating a new array based on the results.
*/

// Array destructuring
const numbers1 = [1, 2, 3];
const [first, second, third] = numbers1;
const [a,b,c] = numbers1;

// Object destructuring
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const { name, age } = person;

// Case 1: Swapping variables
let a1 = 1, b1 = 2;

// Case 2: Nested destructuring

    multiline string.

// Using var
var x = 10;
var x1 =69;

// Using let (block-scoped)
// let is just var but block-scoped version ;0

let y = 20;

// Using const (block-scoped, and cannot be reassigned)
const z = 30;

// Case 1: Reassigning with let
let counter = 0;

// Case 3: Temporal dead zone

/*
Certainly! Here's a summary of the information about `var`, `let`, and `const`:

- **`var`:**
  - **Scope:** Function-scoped or globally scoped.
  - **Hoisting:** Hoisted to the top of the scope, allowing use before declaration.
  - **Reassignment:** Can be reassigned and updated.

- **`let`:**
  - **Scope:** Block-scoped (limited to the block where it is defined).
  - **Hoisting:** Hoisted to the top of the block but not initialized, 
  so cannot be used before declaration.
  - **Reassignment:** Can be reassigned and updated.

- **`const`:**
  - **Scope:** Block-scoped.
  - **Hoisting:** Hoisted to the top of the block but not initialized.
  - **Reassignment:** Cannot be reassigned after the initial assignment, 
  making it a constant value.

**Recommendations:**
- Use `var` for older code or if function-scoping is specifically required.
- Prefer `let` for variables that may need to be reassigned within a block.
- Use `const` for constants and values that should not be reassigned after 
the initial assignment, providing a more robust and predictable code structure.
